# APU Template

Implement a Python class `APU` that contains audio control registers used by the Game Boy hardware. This is a stub implementation: actual audio behavior is not required.

## Requirements
- Registers: NR10â€“NR14, NR52, and wave RAM (0xFF30â€“0xFF3F).
- On `read(addr)`, return the current register value if known, otherwise 0xFF.
- On `write(addr, value)`, store the value in internal register map.
- Provide a `reset()` method that sets all values to 0.

Stub only: no sound generation, timers, or waveform logic required.

Class signature:
```python
class APU:
    def reset(self): ...
    def read(self, addr: int) -> int: ...
    def write(self, addr: int, value: int): ...
